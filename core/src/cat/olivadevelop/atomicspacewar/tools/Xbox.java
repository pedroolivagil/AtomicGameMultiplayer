    * It seems there are different versions of gamepads with different ID Strings.
    * Therefore its IMO a better bet to check for:
    * if (controller.getName().toLowerCase().contains("xbox") &&
                  controller.getName().contains("360"))
    *
    * Controller (Gamepad for Xbox 360)
      Controller (XBOX 360 For Windows)
      Controller (Xbox 360 Wireless Receiver for Windows)
      Controller (Xbox wireless receiver for windows)
      XBOX 360 For Windows (Controller)
      Xbox 360 Wireless Receiver
